# CodeForces-JAVA
Codeforces-Java: A repository dedicated to storing my solutions to Codeforces problems, focusing on clean and efficient Java code. I aim to improve my algorithmic skills and share my learning journey.

# Codeforces-Java

This repository contains my Java solutions to various Codeforces programming problems. It serves as a record of my competitive programming practice and a resource for learning.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository: `https://github.com/ayush2003somu/CodeForces-JAVA.git`
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the desired solution.
3.  Compile the Java file: `javac SolutionName.java` (Replace `SolutionName.java` with the actual file name).
4.  Run the compiled class: `java SolutionName` (Replace `SolutionName` with the class name).


## Organization

Solutions are organized within the root directory. Each Java file represents a solution to a specific Codeforces problem.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository includes implementations of various algorithms and data structures, including:


 **Data Structures:**
    * Arrays
    * Lists
    * Hashmaps
    * Sets
    * Queues
